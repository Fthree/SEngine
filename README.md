# SEngine

- An Open Source C++ Opengl engine utilizing the capabilities of Box2D.

- This is meant to be a starting point for your game!

- Under the MIT License.

# Current state

- This engine is not complete! Not by a far stretch. 

- There are some serious refactorings to do!

- Documentation has not been kept up to date and has mostly been edited away. This is my next focus.

- The engine works and there is a small example built into the engine. This utilizes a lot of the primary functionality of the engine.

# Whats to offer?

- Fully working Box2D implementation, ready-to-go.

- 2D OpenGL wrapper. 

- Kept up-to-date as best as I (or contributors) can!

- Very expandable. If you need 3D, implementing bullet and moving to a 3D implementation of OpenGL should be very quick.

# Plans

- Unit tests!!

- Documentation!!

- Any features the engine might need in the future.

# What is this to you?

- A project i've wanted to make open source for far too long.

- Something others can use to make beautiful projects!

- Something I hope we can make fantastic! 


#THANKS!
